/**
 * EasyUI Motion Design Tokens
 * Philosophy: Soft + physical + immediate + controlled
 *
 * Tuning philosophy (Apple HIG-inspired):
 *  - Critical-damping ratio around 0.85-1.0 for buttery, never-bouncy motion.
 *  - Stiffness chosen so the spring reaches ~95% of the target in 350-450ms.
 *  - Mass kept low (0.4-0.8) so motion feels light and immediate.
 *  - Stagger and duration for choreographed reveals.
